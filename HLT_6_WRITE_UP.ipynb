        "One of the most fundamental supervised machine learning approaches for classification and regression is the k-nearest neighbour technique. It's a nonparametric method for categorising data points based on their neighbours' classifications. The basic principle behind KNN is to choose the \"k\" samples with the least distance as the test data's nearest neighbours. These 'k' samples are selected at random from the training data as the initial closest neighbour samples. It is advisable to choose an odd value for 'k' to get a clear prognosis (Achinya 2020).\n",

        "(Achintya and Kumar., 2020) used Artificial Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT) approaches to detect an open-circuit switch problem in a multilevel inverter. The proposed method discovered faulty switches by monitoring capacitor current and switch current data. The Symlet discrete wavelet transform was employed for feature extraction.\n",
